Research Process

To build an interactive no-code canvas interface, I researched libraries that support:
Drag-and-drop node creation
Custom node types
Visual edges between nodes
Runtime validation of connections
Good React and TypeScript support
Flexible styling and UX control

I started by reviewing popular canvas/diagramming libraries commonly used in visual editors or automation tools (like Zapier, n8n, or Retool).

⚖️ Alternatives Compared

Library	            Pros	                            Cons
react-flow          - React-first, simple to use        - Somewhat boilerplate-heavy for advanced features
                    - Custom node support
                    - Zoom, pan, edge drawing           
                    - Active community
rete.js
                    - Node-based editor                 - Steeper learning curve
                    - Plugin ecosystem                  - Plugin-based for basics
                    - Ideal for pipelines
                    
jointJS
                    - Full-featured diagramming         - Complex API
                    - UML & flowchart support           - Not built for React
                    


Why I Chose react-flow
react-flow was the best fit because:

Component-based design fits perfectly into a React app
Highly customizable nodes with full control over position, handles, labels, and interactivity
Easy integration of connection rules and logic
Simple API to manage state (useNodesState, useEdgesState)
Maintained, open-source, and actively used in real-world products (n8n, tldraw, etc.)

Summary
I explored multiple libraries for canvas-based workflow editors.
Compared them based on flexibility, complexity, React compatibility, and ecosystem support.
Chose react-flow for its simplicity, strong React integration, and active support for custom nodes, edges, and validations.
Implemented connection rules (Trigger → Agent → Tool) easily using its onConnect and nodeTypes props.
