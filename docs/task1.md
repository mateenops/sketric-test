SSE Refactor Summary

What Was Changed
1. API Endpoint Switched to GET + SSE
File: app/api/chat-sse/route.ts

Created an Edge Function using export const runtime = 'edge' for real-time, low-latency streaming (great for Vercel).

Switched from POST /api/responses to GET /api/chat-sse?input=...&instructions=...

Initiated a stream from OpenAI via:
openai.responses.create({
  model: 'gpt-4.1',
  instructions,
  input,
  stream: true,
});

Consumed the streaming iterable and pushed each delta (chunk.text) to the client in SSE format:
for await (const chunk of response) {
  const delta = (chunk as any)?.text || '';
  controller.enqueue(`data: ${JSON.stringify({ delta })}\n\n`);
}
Ended the stream using:
controller.enqueue(`event: end\ndata: done\n\n`);
controller.close();
Error handling emits structured SSE event:
controller.enqueue(`event: error\ndata: ${JSON.stringify({ message: err.message })}\n\n`);

Frontend Dependencies
The frontend now listens to this /api/chat-sse endpoint via a readable stream.
Each delta from the assistant is appended to the UI in real time.


Benefits
Improvement	Description
Real-Time Typing Experience	Assistant’s messages appear word-by-word (token-by-token).
Better UX	User sees that the bot is typing—improved engagement.
Lower Perceived Latency	Response starts immediately instead of waiting for full completion.
Edge-Ready	Uses Vercel Edge Function for ultra-low-latency delivery.
Scalable	Handles long responses efficiently without blocking event loop.

Trade-Off	Explanation
No POST Payload	You must send input and instructions via query string; encoding becomes important.
No Retry Logic Yet	SSE doesn't reconnect on failure unless you implement a custom fallback.
Browser Support Limitation	Modern browsers are fine, but older or corporate networks might block text/event-stream.
No JSON Parsing on Final 'done'	"done" is not valid JSON, so event-based parsing was used to avoid frontend crash.
Security Note	No authentication/validation on query parameters yet—can be spoofed unless validated.
