ðŸ“˜ 1. Amplify Research
What is AWS Amplify?
AWS Amplify is a set of tools and services for building full-stack applications on AWS. It abstracts and automates infrastructure provisioning and helps developers focus on features, not config.

Core Capabilities:

Auth (Cognito)
API (REST/Lambda or GraphQL/AppSync)
Data (DynamoDB)
Storage (S3)
Hosting (CDN-backed static site hosting)
CI/CD for frontend apps

Integration with Next.js

Amplify supports both SSR and SSG capabilities in Next.js:
Amplify Hosting deploys and hosts Next.js apps.
API Routes can use Amplify functions (Lambda).
Amplify CLI & libraries integrate with Next.js via:
@aws-amplify/ui-react for UI/Auth
aws-amplify SDK for backend access

Backend Infrastructure Components

Lambda â€“ Serverless compute to run backend functions.
AppSync â€“ Managed GraphQL API service that connects to DynamoDB and Lambda.
DynamoDB â€“ NoSQL database for high-performance, scalable data storage.
Cognito â€“ User authentication, sign-up/sign-in, OAuth2, MFA.

CloudFormationâ€™s Role

Every Amplify CLI action (e.g., amplify add api) generates CloudFormation templates under the hood.
These templates define and manage:
APIs
Databases
Auth flows
Permissions
CloudFormation ensures declarative infrastructure-as-code, version-controlled in Git.
